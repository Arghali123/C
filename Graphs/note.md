# Introduction to Graphs in Programming in C
Graphics programming in C allows devlopers to create visual elements like shapes,images,and text on the screen.It's commonly used in  applications such as vidio games,simulations,and drawing programs.In C,graphics programming can be achieved using libraries like graphics.h(for Turbo C),SDL,OpenGL and others.

# Terms Used in Graphics Programming
- Pixel:The smallest unit of a display,which make up images,shapes,and color on the screen.
- Resolution:The number of pixels in each dimension that can be displayed.For example,a resolution of 640x480 means 640 pixels in width and 480 pixels in height.
- Color Depth:The number of bits used to represent the color of a pixel.
- Coordinate System:The system used to define the postion of objects on the screen,typically with x and y values.
- Rendering:The process of generating the image from models or data into pixels on the screen.
- Frame Buffer:A portion of memory where image data(pixel value) is stored before being displayed on the screen.

# Initialize of Graphics in C
In older compiliers like Turbo C,you use the **graphics.h** libary to initialize and use graphics.Initialization typically involves setting up the graphics driver and the mode.

## Here's a basic example of initializing graphics:

/*The program opens a file output.txt in write mode.
1.)It writes "Hello, World!" to the file using fprintf(). This data is stored in a buffer initially and might not be written to the file immediately.
2.)Calling fflush(file) forces the contents of the buffer to be written to output.txt right away, ensuring that the data is saved even if the buffer is not yet full.
3.)After flushing, the file is closed with fclose().
If you donâ€™t call fflush(), the data might still be written eventually (when the buffer fills up or when you close the file), but fflush() ensures it happens at that specific moment.
